> ### <h2>üîçBACKGROUND</h2>
- Puerto Galera is one of the most visited by the local and foreign tourists here in the Philippines. It is also known as the diving capital of the Philippines due to its marine life with diverse dive sites and beautiful beaches. Tourism is one of the major contributors to the local economy in Puerto Galera and OTG Travel and Tours offers different tours like inland and island tours and services like car rental to help the tourists to have a seamless and hassle-free vacation. 

> ### <h2>‚ùóPROBLEM ENCOUNTERED</h2>
- The major problem with OTG Puerto Galera Travel and Tours is the manual booking. They manually input the customer details, schedule and the tour information, having this kind of process can consume more workload for the staff and it can lead to data duplication that can lead to booking conflict. OTG Puerto Galera don‚Äôt have an official website, and it is the major requirement to be accredited by the DOT to renew their business franchise. OTG Puerto Galera is spending 15,000 pesos per month on their Facebook page just to engage their page and many tourists will book them. 

> ### <h2>üí°PROPOSED SOLUTION</h2>
- To develop a customizable service for inland and island activities and car and motor rentals that is offered by OTG Puerto Galera Travel and Tours. Another one is to have a secure booking, ensuring all the amenities and services are confirmed.

  
> ### <h2>üóÇÔ∏èPROJECT APPLICATION OVERVIEW</h2>
- EUF Portal is a cross-platform Flutter application designed for the efficient management of tourist transactions, staff administration, and analytics/reporting for the EUF (Ecological User Fee) system. The app supports both desktop and mobile layouts, providing a responsive and user-friendly experience for authorized personnel.

> ### <h2>üõ†Ô∏èDEVELOPMENT MODEL</h2>
- Plan - the development team collaborated with the OTG Puerto Galera to identify and prioritize the system‚Äôs essential needs. The team and the management agree to build a web based booking system that provides a booking system for tourists to have a seamless booking experience.

- Design - The development team focused on planning the system‚Äôs overall technical architecture, and efficiency. This stage is for creating wireframes and mockups to visualize the user interface and define how users would interact with the booking system. The database structure was carefully designed to support smooth handling of bookings, user accounts, schedules, and real-time availability. 

- Development - The team started building the main features of the system. We first worked on the login functions for staff and owners to manage the system. The team added the booking feature so tourists could choose dates and book easily. They also created a simple analytics page to help track bookings and user activity. Each part of the system was developed step by step, and we made sure everything worked properly before moving on to the next.

- Testing - The testing phase was done during the development to check if each feature worked properly. The team tested every time they added something new to make sure there were no errors. This helped the team to find and fix bugs early and keep the system running smoothly.

- Launch - The team transferred all the completed modules to the live server. This step made the system accessible online, allowing real users and stakeholders to interact with it in real time. The team also checked if everything was working correctly in the live environment and made a few small adjustments to improve performance and usability.

- Review - The team collected feedback from users and stakeholders through testing and observation. This helped identify areas that needed improvement. Based on the feedback, the team made adjustments to improve the system‚Äôs performance and usability, making sure it met the needs of Puerto Galera‚Äôs tourism management.
